# X-ray data analysis

This is a repository created for my developments with learning X-ray data and analysis.

Approach and goals
1. Learning X-ray data - extraction, reduction, interpretation
2. Create Xray spectra and lightcurves
3. Data analysis

Here I try to learn how to download and prepare data of star Proxima Centauri from XMM newton so that I can analyze it using XSPEC.
File - 1. Process
This list all the steps I took which includes installation, data reduction and generating spectra and so on.

Folder - 2. Figures
This includes screenshots of in-between processes. In file "1. Process" wherever I mention "Refer figure 1" This is the place to find them.

File - 3. Overview
Here I write my progress and some thoughts and learnings in key sentences.
