# X-ray data analysis

## Approach and goals
## 1. Learning X-ray data - extraction, reduction, interpretation
## 2. Create Xray spectra and lightcurves
## 3. Data analysis

To learn abour X-ray data analysis, I am focusing on learning XSPEC and using data of Proxima Centauri from XMM-Newton.

I was able to successfully install HEASoft and SAS and started to experiment on data from MOS detector because this one showed no error while I was working on it.
For data from PN detector, either the files were not good for this particular data that I downloaded or it could have gone corrupt during extraction (not sure)

I was able to learn some aspect of X-ray data like the process of observering and obtaining the data is very different from the one we get photometry, its quite indirect.

It took me a while to grasp the idea behind the lightcurve you get for xrays.

I was able to reach till the process of generating spectra and lightcurve of Proxima centauri.

But when I wanted to proceed with data analysis using XSPEC, my wsl got corrupt and I could not go further now.

So now, I need to again, redo the whole installation of HEASOFT and SAS  and redo this data extraction and reduction to move further.

As I will do this again, this directory will be further updated accordingly.

Status for my Approach and goals
1. Learning X-ray data - extraction, reduction, interpretation - Achieved
2. Create Xray spectra and lightcurves - achieved
3. Data analysis - pending
